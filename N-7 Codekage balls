Sakura, who is very good friend of Naruto, gave him a question. Thinking that Naruto is stupid and will not be able to answer. As Naruto is hard-working he managed to solve it easily without any issues. Now, check if you can solve it without any difficulty.

Problem: You are given X empty bags and you have to fill them with C balls, where C is always a multiple of X. Now, there are only two ways in which you have to fill the bags. Also, you can only fill X balls in one minute. 

1- One way is to put a ball in each bag, and 

2- other way is to first choose the bag with smallest number of balls and fill it with X balls.

Now, you have to figure out, can the distribution of balls can be different by using both the methods



Constraints: 

1 <= T <= 200

1 <= X <= C <= 10^18

X is divisible by C.



Explanation: (for first two testcases)1- final distribution by both cases are:
a)           b)
             O   
O O          O
O O          O O
O O          O O
O O          O O
O O          O O
Hence, the answer is YES.

2- In next case both distributions will be same.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers C and X.

Output Format:
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the final distributions of balls can be different or "NO" if they will be the same (without quotes).
